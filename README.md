When using this code please cite the following papers : The two first ones concern the model and its use in clusterng and the last ones concern the model and its use in discrimination.

The script to run is: main_MixFRHLP_EM.R. The main function is in ModelLearner.R:
EM(...) for the EM algorithm (respectively CEM(...) for the CEM-like algorithm)

### THE SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EACH PYTHON FILE. For more detailed description, please see the individual files

1) main_MixFRHLP_EM _Main script to run the EM or CEM algorithm_
2) ModelLearner _Contains the two functions of the EM and the CEM algorithm._
3) datasets _Contains the object to load (mainly contains the dataset)_                        
4) MixModel _The MixModel class containts the data object and the model settings (number of clusters, the number of regimes, the degree of polynomials, the order of the logistic regression)_
4) MixParam _Initializes and updates (the M-step) the model parameters (parameters of the logistic process for each of the clusters, polynomial regression coefficients, and the variances for the regmies for each cluster)._
5) MixStats _Calculates mainly the posterior memberships (E-step), the loglikelihood, the parition, different information criterias BIC, ICL, etc_
6) ModelOptions _contains some options needed to set before learning the model (like the number of runs, threshold, type of initialization, etc)._
8) enums _Used to enumerate the variance type (heteroskedastic or homoscedastic)_
9) RegressionDesinger.py _Design matrices for the polynomial regression and the logistic regression_
10) utils _Contains mainly the model_logit function that calculates the pobabilities according to the multinomial logistic model, and an efficient Iteratively Reweighted Least-Squares (IRLS) algorithm.
